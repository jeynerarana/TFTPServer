/s make a function that recieves the data
	int recv_data(char *block){
	}
//main class
	set a default blocksize (512)
	set an array of bytes initialized with blocksize
	open a file
	while the file doesn reach eof
		count =0;
		if ( count mod 512 != 0){
			add each character to the array[blocksize]
		}
		call the function ascci/plaintect to..
		send/recv data;
		erase the contents in the array
		
		count ++;
